# 1. Basic - Print all integers from 0 to 150.

# for i in range(0, 151):
# print(i)

# 2. Multiples of Five - Print all the multiples of 5 from 5 to 1,000

# for i in range(0, 1000, 5):
# print(i)

# 3.  Print integers 1 to 100. If divisible by 5, print "div by 5" instead. If divisible by 10, print "div by 10".

# def check_div():
# for i in range(0, 100):
# if i % 5 == 0:
# return 'div by 5'
# else:
# return 'div by 10'


# 4. Whoah. That Sucker's Huge - Add odd integers from 0 to 500,000, and print the final sum.

# def addOddNumbers(numbers):
#total = 0
# for num in numbers:
# if num % 2 == 1:
#total += num
#print([0, 500000])

# Countdown by Fours - Print positive numbers starting at 2018, counting down by fours.

# Flexible Counter - Set three variables: lowNum, highNum, mult. Starting at lowNum and going through highNum, print only the integers that are a multiple of mult. For example, if lowNum=2, highNum=9, and mult=3, the loop should print 3, 6, 9 (on successive lines)

def a(b, c):
    print(b+c)


print(a(1, 2) + a(2, 3))
